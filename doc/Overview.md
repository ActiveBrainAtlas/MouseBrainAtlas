This system automatically aligns histological series to a standard atlas by identification of cyto-architectural landmarks. The goal is to enable mapping of cell markers across brains.

Data
=========

[Complete list of brains](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QHW_hoMVMcKMEqqkzFnrppu8XT92BPdIagpSqQMAJHA/edit?usp=sharing)

This system works with sagittal series labeled with markers such as:
- cell type marker, e.g. ChAT
- neuronal tracers, e.g. pseudo-rabies and delta-G rabies

Tissues must also be counter-stained for Nissl to demonstrate cytoarchitecture. Possible Nissl stains include:
- thionin (brightfield) 
- [Neurotrace Blue](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/N21479) (fluorescent)

### Task list for visualization

* Improve organization of layout: make buttons smaller and in one
  row. Make boundaties movable. Make brain image canvas fill the
  available area (rather than keep proportions)
* Select a good set of colors (easily distinguisable)
* Write a simple interactive method where we start with an initial
  set of models and then iteratively edit it and recalc models.

  set of models and then iteratively edit it and recalc models.
* Get data from Sean. Identify directories on gordon.
* ~~Create a diary/lab-book in which you document the processed stacks, who labeled what, etc.~~
* ~~Make gui software work, write directions in a readme.md file~~
* ~~Export descriptors and human labels from the GUI to files and load those files into a notebook.~~
* In the notebook, try supervised (using human labels) and unsupervised classification method. When those look good, export back to GUI for another iteration.

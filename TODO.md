GUI Functionality
-----------------

* ~~Select a good set of colors (easily distinguisable)~~
* ~~Create a diary/lab-book in which you document the processed stacks, who labeled what, etc.~~
* ~~Make gui software work, write directions in a readme.md file~~
* ~~Export descriptors and human labels from the GUI to files and load those files into a notebook.~~

* Make buttons smaller and in one row.

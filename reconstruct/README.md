## Construct Volumes
- `compute_score_volume.ipynb`: reconstruct score volumes from score maps, and generates `[stack]_scoreVolume_[label].bp` and `[stack]_scoreVolume_limits.txt`.
- `compute_thumbnail_volume.ipynb`: reconstruct volumes from thumbnail section images.
- `compute_contour_volume.ipynb`:

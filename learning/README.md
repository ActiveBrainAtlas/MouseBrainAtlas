This folder contains code related to learning texture detectors. This include extracting patches, transforming to feature vectors, and training SVM classifiers.

`extract_test_features_dnn.ipynb` runs on the Workstation equipped with GPU. It calls MXNet to compute features for patches through forward pass over a deep neural network.
